Config Utility for 'ThinkPad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with TrackPoint' (0B47189) for OSX

Adapted from https://github.com/unknownzerx/tpkb, https://github.com/lentinj/tp-compact-keyboard

- Config
	- sensitivity xx (I'd like 11-13)
		- Set sensitivity of TrackPoint. xx is hex value 01-FF (It's not linearly, and can't catch rules)

	- others
		- todo ...
